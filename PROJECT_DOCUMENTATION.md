### 2.2 System Architecture

```
GitHub Repository
       ↓ (Webhook)
Jenkins CI/CD Server
       ↓ (Automated Pipeline)
Docker Image Build
       ↓
Container Registry
       ↓
Production Server (AWS/Azure)
       ↓
ELK Stack Monitoring
```

**Pipeline Flow:**
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins pipeline
3. Jenkins clones repository and installs dependencies
4. Application is built using Vite (npm run build)
5. Docker image is created using multi-stage Dockerfile
6. Old container is stopped, new container is deployed
7. Application runs on port 80 via Nginx
8. Logs are sent to ELK Stack for monitoring

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 3.1 Docker Implementation

**Multi-Stage Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
